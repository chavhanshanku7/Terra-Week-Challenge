# Day-01 - Terra-Week-Challenge
## Introduction to Terraform and Terraform Basics

### Introduction
As part of the Terra-Week-Challenge, Day-01 is dedicated to understanding what Terraform is and how it can revolutionize the way we manage and provision infrastructure. In this post, we'll explore why Terraform is a powerful tool for DevOps and Cloud Engineers, walk through the installation process, and dive into some key Terraform terminologies with examples.

### What is Terraform
Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON. Terraform allows you to describe your infrastructure in a file that can be versioned, reused, and shared, making your infrastructure configurations consistent and scalable.

### How Terraform Can Help You Manage Infrastructure as Code?
Consistency: Terraform ensures that your infrastructure is consistent across different environments, eliminating configuration drift.
Automation: Automate the provisioning and management of your infrastructure with simple, reusable scripts.
Scalability: Easily manage and scale complex infrastructure by codifying it into simple configuration files.
Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to manage and track changes to your infrastructure code.

### Why Do We Need Terraform?
#### Simplifying Infrastructure Provisioning
In traditional IT environments, provisioning infrastructure manually is time-consuming and error-prone. With Terraform, you can automate this process, reducing the risk of human error and making it easier to manage complex infrastructures.

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Terraform is platform-agnostic, meaning it can manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and even on-premises solutions. This flexibility allows you to use a single tool to manage all your infrastructure needs, regardless of where they are hosted.

#### Reproducibility
Terraform configurations can be reused to reproduce environments with minimal effort. This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where you need to deploy identical environments for testing, staging, and production.

### How to Install Terraform and Set Up the Environment?
#### Step 1: Install Terraform
To get started with Terraform, you'll first need to install it on your local machine. Hereâ€™s how to do it on different operating systems:

- Windows
1. Download the [Terraform binary](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install#windows) for Windows.

2. Unzip the downloaded file and move the terraform.exe to a directory included in your system's PATH.
   
- macOS
1. Run the following command to install Terraform using Homebrew:
   
   ```
      brew tap hashicorp/tap
      brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

3. To update to the latest version of Terraform, first update Homebrew:

   ```
      brew update

4. Then, run the upgrade command to download and use the latest Terraform version:

   ```
      brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/terraform   

5. Verify the installation:

   ```
       terraform -v
       terraform -help

- Ubuntu/Debian
1. Ensure that your system is up to date and you have installed the gnupg, software-properties-common, and curl packages installed. You will use these packages to verify HashiCorp's GPG signature and install HashiCorp's Debian package repository:

   ```
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common

2. Install the HashiCorp GPG key:

   ```
      wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
      gpg --dearmor | \
      sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

3. Verify the key's fingerprint:

   ```
      gpg --no-default-keyring \
      --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
      --fingerprint

4. Add the official HashiCorp repository to your system. The lsb_release -cs command finds the distribution release codename for your current system, such as buster, groovy, or sid:

   ```
      echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
      https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

5. Download the package information from HashiCorp & install the Terraform:

   ```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt-get install terraform
   ```

6. Verify the installation

   ```
      terraform -v
      terraform -help
  
#### Step 2: Set Up AWS Environment
To manage AWS infrastructure using Terraform, you'll need to configure your AWS credentials:

1. Install the AWS CLI:

   ```
      sudo apt-get install awscli -y

3. Configure the AWS CLI:
   ```
      aws configure

Note:- 
You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, region, and output format.

#### Step 3: Set Up Azure Environment

1. Install the Azure CLI:

   ```
      curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

2. Log in to your Azure account:

   ```
      az login
   
3. Set your subscription (Optional):

   ```
      az account set --subscription "subscription_id"
   
4. Create a Service Principal for Terraform:

   ```
      az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/subscription_id"

Note down the sppId, password, and tenant.

5. Set Up Terraform Configuration:
- Create a directory for your Terraform files:

  ```
     mkdir terraform-azure-setup
     cd terrform-azure-setup
     
- Create a main.tf file with the following content:
  ```
     provider "azurerm"{
         features = {}

         tenant_id = "your_tenant_id"
         subscription_id = "your_subscription_id"
         client_id = "your_app_id"
         client_secret = "your password"
     }

     resource "azurerm_resource_group" "azure_resource"{
         name = "azure-resources"
         location = "East US"
     }

6. Initialize the Terraform Environment:

   ```
      terraform init
   ```

7. Validate the Terraform Configuration:
    
   ```
      terraform validate
   ```

8. Apply the Terraform Configuration:

   ```
      terraform apply
   ```

9. Destroy the Terraform Configuration:

   ```
      terraform destroy
   ```
    
#### Step 4: Set Up GCP Environment

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK:
   ```
      sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg
      echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
      curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

2. Authenticate with GCP:
   - Initialize the Google CLoud SDK and logged into it.
     
   ```
      gcloud init
   ```
    
   - Follow the prompts to log in and set your default project.
     
3. Create a Service Account for Terraform:

   ```
      gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform
      --display-name "Terrform Service Account"
   ```
   
4. Grant the neccessary roles to the Service Account:

   ```
      gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID
      --member="serviceAccount:terraform@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      --role="roles/editor"
   ```
   
5. Generate a Key file for the Service Account:

   ```
      gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/ terraform-key.json
      --iam-account terraform@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```
   
6. Set Up Terraform Configuration:
   - Create a directory for your Terraform files:
   ```
      mkdir terraform-gcp-setup
      cd terrform-gcp-setup
   ```

   - Create a main.tf file with the following content:
   ```
      provider ""google" {
         credentails = file("<PATH_TO_KEY_FILE>")
         project = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
         region = "us-central1"
      }

      resource "google_compute_instance" "gcp_resource"{
         name = "terraform-instance"
         machine_type = "f1-micro"
         zone = "us-central1-a"

         boot_disk {
            initialize_params {
               image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
            }
         }

         network_interface {
            netwrok = "default"
            access_config {}
         }
      }
   ```
Note:- Replace <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> with the path to your Service Account key file (e.g. ~/terraform-key.json).

7. Initialize the Terraform Environment:
    
    ```
       terraform init
    
7. Validate the Terraform Configuration:
    
    ```
       terraform validate
    
8. Apply the Terraform Configuration:
    
    ```
       terraform apply
    
9.  Destroy the Terraform Configuration:

    ```
       terraform destroy
